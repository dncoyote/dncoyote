<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bilal Ahmed</h1>

<h3 align="center">Maker and breaker of stuff.ðŸ¤–</h3>

Hey there, I'm a software engineer from India with a passion for both technology and the arts. I thrive on diving into the ever-evolving tech world and turning innovative concepts into user-friendly software. 

But that's not all. Beyond the realm of code, I'm equally enthralled by the world of arts. Whether it's painting, design, or any other creative endeavor, I love expressing myself through various artistic mediums.

I'm also a strong advocate for open source collaboration. It's incredible how we can join forces and craft remarkable technology together!
